## Why

slowfoot is a static site generator. it should be a perfect fit for headless CMSs. It borrows concepts from gridsome, sanity io, eleventy... I just didn't want to die in js/node/npm hell. so php ftw :)

## Install

```bash
$ composer require cwmoss/slowfoot dev-main

# initialize minimal project
$ vendor/bin/slowfoot init

# start the dev server
$ vendor/bin/slowfoot dev
```
